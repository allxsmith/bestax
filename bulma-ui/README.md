## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Install the package

```bash
npm install @allxsmith/bestax-bulma
# or
yarn add @allxsmith/bestax-bulma
```

### 2. Import Bulma CSS

You must include Bulma‚Äôs CSS in your project. The easiest way is to import it in your main JS/TS file:

```js
import 'bulma/css/bulma.min.css';
```

Or add it via CDN in your HTML:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bulma@1.0.0/css/bulma.min.css"
/>
```

### 3. (Optional) Add an Icon Library

Many components work well with icons. We recommend [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) or [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/):

```bash
npm install @fortawesome/fontawesome-free
# or
npm install react-icons
```

And then import in your code as needed.

### 4. Quick Example

Here‚Äôs how to use the `Button` component:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from '@allxsmith/bestax-bulma';
import 'bulma/css/bulma.min.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button color="primary" onClick={() => alert('Clicked!')}>
        Click Me
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
