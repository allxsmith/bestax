/**
 * Hold the colour tuples to the stylesheet, in both directions.
 *
 * Adding a colour has bitten twice, once each way, and each is a different
 * kind of silence.
 *
 * A colour the CSS has and `validColors` does not is dropped by membership:
 * `<Block bgColor="white-ter" />` rendered no background while
 * `has-background-white-ter` sat in `dist/bestax.css` and the library's own
 * docs used it. `black-bis` and `black-ter` were in the tuple and the white
 * pair was not, which is the shape of it: an asymmetry nobody could see by
 * reading either file alone.
 *
 * A colour in `validColors` whose COMPONENT modifier has no rule is worse,
 * because it renders a class. `Notification.color`, `Progress.color` and
 * `Hero.color` are typed off the tuple and emit `is-<colour>`, so adding the
 * white shades made `<Notification color="white-ter">` emit a dead modifier,
 * and without the development warning `black-ter` gets, since only the black
 * pair was declared in `UNSTYLED_MODIFIER_COLORS`. Fixing the first defect
 * created the second, which is why both are checked here.
 *
 * ON THE SHAPE OF THIS FILE, because it got there the hard way. An earlier
 * version inferred which components to compare by scanning source for a
 * `color` prop typed off the tuple AND a `` `is-${color}` `` emission, then
 * cross-checked the two signals, counted occurrences, stripped comments and
 * balanced parentheses to do it. Review found the same class of defect in
 * that machinery five rounds running: a one-line substring standing in for a
 * type, a first-match standing in for a prop, a truncating regex reading as
 * "warns about nothing". Each fix added a reader and the next reader had the
 * same flaw.
 *
 * So the inference is gone. The element list comes from one signal, the
 * `warnUnstyledColor` call sites, which is a function call with a string
 * literal and the least fragile thing available: a component calling it is
 * declaring that its colour values can be dead. Everything else compared here
 * is DATA — tuples and stylesheet rules — rather than behaviour inferred from
 * how code is written.
 *
 * What that gives up is stated rather than papered over: a component that
 * emits the modifier and never warns is not detected. Three attempts to cover
 * it are what produced those five rounds, and each introduced a way for the
 * guard to fail while the library was fine. The same gap already applies to
 * `Calendar` and `TimeWheels`, which emit it today and are not exported from
 * `src/index.ts`. Closing it properly wants the library to say which
 * components warn, not a test to guess.
