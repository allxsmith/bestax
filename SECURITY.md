## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this library, please report it responsibly. Do not disclose the issue publicly until we've had a chance to address it.

### How to Report

### What to Expect

- We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
- We aim to triage and confirm the issue within 7 days.
- If accepted, we'll work on a fix and coordinate a disclosure timeline with you.

- Credit: We'll credit you in the release notes or advisory unless you prefer anonymity.

We appreciate your help in keeping our library secure!

## Additional Notes
