## Setting Up & Running the Project

Get up and running quickly with these steps, whether you want to contribute or just explore the project locally.

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/allxsmith/bestax.git
cd bestax
npm install
```

### 2. Run the Documentation Site

From the root of the monorepo, start the Docusaurus documentation site:

```bash
npm run docs
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the docs.

### 3. Run Storybook

To explore and develop components interactively:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

Visit the displayed local URL to view Storybook.

### 4. Build All Packages

To build all packages in the repo:

```bash
npm run build
```

### 5. Run All Checks

This will run build, typecheck, tests (with coverage), lint, format check, and Storybook build:

```bash
npm run all
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Fork and clone the repository.**
2. **Create a branch** off `main` for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature
   ```
3. **Install dependencies** from the root if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Make your changes** in the appropriate workspace (`bulma-ui` for components, `docs` for documentation).
5. **Update/add unit tests** (coverage must remain at 95% or higher).
6. **Add or update Storybook stories** for UI-related changes.
7. **Update documentation** in `/docs` as needed.
8. **Run all checks**:

   ```bash
   npm run all
   ```

   This command will run build, typecheck, tests (w/ coverage), lint, format check, and Storybook build.

9. **Commit your changes** following the [commit message guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines).
10. **Push and open a Pull Request** targeting the `main` branch.
11. **Participate in code review** and update your PR if requested.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Describe your change** clearly in the PR.
- **Reference related issues** if applicable.
- **Keep PRs focused**: One feature/fix per PR is preferred.
- **Ensure all quality checks pass** before requesting review.

## Semantic Release & Publishing

We use [Semantic Release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/) to automate publishing of the `bulma-ui` package as `bulma-bestax` on npm.

- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to trigger releases.
- The PR title and commit messages should reflect the type of release (fix, feat, BREAKING CHANGE, etc.).
- Only the `main` branch is published.

---

## Code Quality Standards

- **Unit tests** required for all new features and bug fixes.
- **Coverage must not drop below 95%.**
- **Linting, formatting, and type checks** must all pass.
- **Storybook stories** required for any visible or interactive UI change.
- **Documentation** must be updated to reflect your changes (see [Documentation](#documentation)).

---

## Commit Message Guidelines

- **Format all commit messages as follows:**
  - **Subject line:** Imperative mood, â‰¤ 80 chars
  - **Blank line**
  - **List of changes (bullet points or short sentences)**
  - **Optional paragraph describing the motivation or context**

**Example:**

```
Add support for Bulma breadcrumb component

- Implement Breadcrumb component and tests
- Add Storybook stories

This adds full support for Bulma's breadcrumb navigation and documents usage.
```

---

## Component Scope

- **All changes to `bulma-ui` should focus on components available in the Bulma CSS framework.**
- If you wish to propose components outside the Bulma spec, please open an issue to discuss first.

---

## Documentation

- **All public APIs and components must be documented in Markdown in `/docs/api/`** (see existing structure for organization).
