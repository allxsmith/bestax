# ============================================================================
# CONTENT SIGNALS FOR AI (Modern Standard)
# ============================================================================
# As a condition of accessing this website, you agree to abide by the following
# content signals:
#
# (a)  If a content-signal = yes, you may collect content for the corresponding use.
# (b)  If a content-signal = no, you may not collect content for the corresponding use.
# (c)  If the website operator does not include a content signal for a
#      corresponding use, the website operator neither grants nor restricts
#      permission via content signal with respect to the corresponding use.
#
# The content signals and their meanings are:
#
# search:   building a search index and providing search results (e.g., returning
#           hyperlinks and short excerpts from your website's contents). Search does not
#           include providing AI-generated search summaries.
# ai-input: inputting content into one or more AI models (e.g., retrieval
#           augmented generation, grounding, or other real-time taking of content for
#           generative AI search answers).
# ai-train: training or fine-tuning AI models.
#
# ANY RESTRICTIONS EXPRESSED VIA CONTENT SIGNALS ARE EXPRESS RESERVATIONS OF
# RIGHTS UNDER ARTICLE 4 OF THE EUROPEAN UNION DIRECTIVE 2019/790 ON COPYRIGHT
# AND RELATED RIGHTS IN THE DIGITAL SINGLE MARKET.

# ============================================================================
# PERMISSIONS (All uses allowed - search engines and AI)
